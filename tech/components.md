{{ page.description }}

* Custom elements are new HTML elements, created imperatively.
* Templates are sections of HTML to be used by scripts.
* Shadow DOM is encapsulated DOM and styling - with composition.
* HTML import is a way of including one HTML document in another, declaratively.

[framework]({{site.baseurl}}tech/js-frameworks.html).
