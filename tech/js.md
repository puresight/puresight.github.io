[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
([JS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript))
is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, dynamic scripting language—that
supports object-oriented
([OOP](http://searchsoa.techtarget.com/definition/object-oriented-programming)),
imperative, and functional programming
([FP](https://wiki.haskell.org/Functional_programming))
styles.

It is in web browsers, web servers, middleware, microservices, databases,
embedded devices, phones, televisions, game consoles, e-book readers,
drones, cars, toasters (ok, maybe not toasters) and who knows where else these days.
It's ubiquitous.

Language
--------

Since 2012, web browsers fully support
[ECMAScript 5.1](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/)
specification. Really old browsers just support
[ECMAScript 3](http://www-archive.mozilla.org/js/language/E262-3.pdf).
In June 2015, ECMA International published the sixth major version (ES6)
called [ECMAScript 2015](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/).

New [ECMAScript](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/)
standards are landing every year now; the language is growing so fast that
_transpiling_ is a practical necessity.
