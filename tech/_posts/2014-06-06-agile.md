_“We have come to value individuals and interactions over processes and tools.”_

This is the first value statement of
The Manifesto for [Agile]({{site.baseurl}}tech/agile.html) Software Development
and the essential cornerstone for people creating software together.

It is a concise statement that is easy to miss.
It is an epic statement that can span all of human history from our fall to our salvation.
I consider it the most important sentence I've read in my software development career.
