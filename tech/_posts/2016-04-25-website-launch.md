description: "Welcome to the new website I built using Jekyll."
---

Welcome to my site. I built with [Jekyll]({{site.baseurl}}tech/jekyll.html),
because its tech aligns with what I chose at
[Texas A&M]({{site.baseurl}}clients/tamu.html)
in 2011, where I created websites in a static site generator named
_Excelsis_â€”that I made using many of the same ideas,
like templating, markdown, files to hold the posts & pages
(not a database, like a CMS), and encoding config in data markup, like JSON or [YAML]({{site.baseurl}}tech/yaml.html)
instead of a programming language.
