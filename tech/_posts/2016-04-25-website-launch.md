Hi! Welcome to my homepage.

This place I built with the [Jekyll]({{site.baseurl}}tech/jekyll.html)
tools. Jekyll's tech aligns with what I chose at
[Texas A&M]({{site.baseurl}}clients/tamu.html)
in 2011, when I built websites using a static site generator named _Excelsis_
that I made, using many of the same ideas - such as templating, markdown,
using regular files to hold the posts & pages
(not a database, like a CMS), and
encoding config in data markup like JSON or [YAML]({{site.baseurl}}tech/yaml.html)
instead of a programming language.
