description: "Welcome to the new website I built using Jekyll."
---

Welcome to my site. I built with [Jekyll]({{site.baseurl}}tech/jekyll.html)
because its tech aligns with what I chose at
[Texas A&M]({{site.baseurl}}clients/tamu.html),
where I assembled websites in a generator/CMS
(named _Excelsis_) that I created using many of the same ideas,
like templating, markdown, post & page copy in files
(not a database), and encoding config in data markup,
like JSON or [YAML]({{site.baseurl}}tech/yaml.html)
instead of a programming language.
