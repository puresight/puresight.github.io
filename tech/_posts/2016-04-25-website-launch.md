Hi! Welcome to my homepage.

This place I built with the [Jekyll]({{site.baseurl}}tech/jekyll.html)
tools. At [Texas A&M]({{site.baseurl}}clients/tamu.html)
in 2011, I built websites using a
static site generator I named _Excelsis_,
which I made using many of the
same ideas like templating, markdown, writing config in data markup language
e.g. JSON or [YAML]({{site.baseurl}}tech/jekyll.html) (not the programming
language, like WordPress), using files to hold the posts & pages
(not a database like a CMS).
