{{ page.description }}

I built with [Jekyll]({{site.baseurl}}tech/jekyll.html)
because its tech aligns with what I chose at
[Texas A&M]({{site.baseurl}}clients/tamu.html),
where I assembled websites in a generator/CMS
named _Excelsis_—that I created using similar stuff
like templating, markdown, post & page copy in files
(not a database), and encoding config in data markup—like JSON or
[YAML]({{site.baseurl}}tech/yaml.html)
instead of a programming language.
