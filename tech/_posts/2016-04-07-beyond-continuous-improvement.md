I’ve noticed with clothes, often a lower quality and less expensive item pairs better with an outfit than something of more obvious desire, e.g. a $20 converse sneaker over a leather shoe costing six times that much.

In light of a video I watched this week — I stumbled upon an excellent talk called [Beyond Continuous Improvement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqEeIG8aPPk) given in 1994 by __Dr. Russell Ackoff__ — this is explained by _Systems Thinking._ Any overall outfit is what matters most, and how shoes match and fit in matters more, than whether the shoes are composed of high quality materials.

Hmm, might this apply to apps? We hesitate to ask the question because as software craftsmen, we delight in making features of high quality and intrinsic value. Not to imply that quality doesn’t matter but: are we open to the possibility that components integrate into an application, and even how well that application integrates into a client’s environment, is more significant, when our concern is __*value as defined by the customer?*__
