Well, it can!
The [meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/feeds/)
website creates a [feed]({{site.baseurl}}tech/syndication.html)
of the meetings you said you'll be attending;
and Google's Calendar app lets you add an external calendar by URL.

Just a few steps:

1. Login to Meetup.com, and go to its [homepage](http://www.meetup.com/).
2. Click the calendar button (next to the search box).
3. Scroll down a a little down; on the right side, see a calendar: under the calendar, see an "Export toâ€¦" button; click there.
4. From the "Sync Meetups you're attending with your personal calendar" menu, choose "Google calendar," for your Android phone.
5. Login to [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/render#main_7) on your desktop computer.
6. In the leftmost column, click the down-arrow menu button to the right of "Other Calendars," and select "Add by URL."
7. Paste the URL you got from Meetup.com to add.

Integration between companies' services is always fragile
(because when they're competing against each other, there is no incentive
for them to make it easy on you).
So, be sure to test this out to see if it actually works, on your phone.

For me, this life hack works today.
And I hope it helps you, too!
So you'll remember to attend the meetups you signed up for,
leave on time, and arrive early enough to get a snack and enjoy
conversation.
