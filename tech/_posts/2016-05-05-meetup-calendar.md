Well, it can! The meetup.com
website creates a [feed of the meetings](http://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/feeds/)
you said you'll be attending.
And Google's Calendar app lets you add an
[external calendar by URL.]({{site.baseurl}}tech/syndication.html)

So, here are seven easy steps to tie it together →

1. Login to Meetup.com, and go to its [homepage](http://www.meetup.com/).
2. Click the calendar button (next to the search box).
3. Scroll a little down, and on the right side, see a calendar: under it, click the "Export to…" button.
4. From the "Sync Meetups you're attending with your personal calendar" menu, choose "Google calendar," for your Android phone.
5. Login to [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/) on your desktop computer.
6. In the leftmost column, click the down-arrow menu button to the right of "Other Calendars," and select "Add by URL."
7. Paste the URL you got from Meetup.com to add.

Integration between companies' services is always fragile;
because when they're competing against each other there is no incentive
to make that easy on you.

Sync your phone, then test it.
Works for me today! I hope it helps you, too.
So you'll attend the meetups you signed up for,
leaving in time for them to arrive early.
