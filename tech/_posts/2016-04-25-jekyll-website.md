Hi! Welcome to my homepage.

This place I built with the [Jekyll](/tech/jekyll.html)
tools. At Texas A&M in 2011, I built websites using a
static site generator I named _Excelsis_, which I built using many of the
same ideas like templating, markdown, config in files in data markup language
like JSON or YAML (not the programming
language, like WordPress does), using files to hold the copy
of posts and pages (most web content mgmt systems put them in their DBMS).
