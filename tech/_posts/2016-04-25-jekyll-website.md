Hi! Welcome to my homepage.

This place I built with the [Jekyll](/tech/jekyll.html)
tools. At [Texas A&M](http://liberalartsarchive.tamu.edu/html/home.html) in 2011, I built websites using a
static site generator I named _Excelsis_, which I made using many of the
same ideas like templating, markdown, writing config in data markup language
e.g. JSON or YAML (not the programming
language, like WordPress), using files to hold the posts & pages
(not a database like a CMS).
