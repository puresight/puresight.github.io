[YAML](http://www.yaml.org/start.html)
emerged from the work of
Ingy d√∂t Net (author of Perl's Data::Denter),
Oren Ben-Kiki and Clark Evans (around data serialization in the sml-dev group).

Like [JSON](http://www.json.org/),
YAML is a human-friendly, data serialization language.
It takes concepts from programming languages such as
C, Perl, and Python, and ideas from XML
and the data format of e-mail.

YAML is the coolness behind the [Jekyll SSG]({{site.baseurl}}tech/static-site-generators.html)
awesome "front matter" feature.
