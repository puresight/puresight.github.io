## Some Quotes

Robert C. Martin, _Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship:_

> “The ratio of time spent reading versus writing is well over 10 to 1. We are constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code. Therefore, making it easy to read makes it easier to write.”

Tom DeMarco, _Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams:_

> “The business we’re in is more sociological than technological, more dependent on workers' abilities to communicate with each other than their abilities to communicate with machines.”

Bertrand Meyer, _Agile!: The Good, the Hype and the Ugly:_

> “To focus on the visible at the expense of the essential is irresponsible.”
