“Test-driven development is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: first an (initially failing) automated test case is written that defines a desired improvement or new function. Then, the minimum amount of code is written to pass that test, and finally one refactors the new code to acceptable standards” (Wikipedia).

Back-end
-------------
* [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) tests run serially for flexible & accurate reporting; mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases
* [Istanbul](https://www.npmjs.com/package/istanbul) code coverage tool
* [Should](https://www.npmjs.com/package/should) test framework agnostic assertions

Front-end
-----------------
* [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) testing framework makes asynchronous testing fun
* [Jasmine](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine) testing framework for JavaScript
* [Phantom](http://phantomjs.org/) headless browser with a JS & DOM API, CSS selectors, JSON, Canvas, SVG, and more.
