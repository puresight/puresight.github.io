Texas A&M  University’s
[college of liberal arts](http://liberalartsarchive.tamu.edu/html/home.html) employed me as a lead software applications developer
from 2009–2013,
where I built a new platform to develop a suite of integrated web applications
for communication of content like stories and events: Excelsis,
about 10,000 lines of code, was built around breaking technology
from the front-end e.g. the JSON data language with the concept
of object inheritance, where properties cascade from the abstract objects
to the specific ones — keeping flexible configuration simple.

Then, we focused on lifting department after department to this platform,
with good success. Its ease of use & integration with the University served
Texas A&M well, and its simplicity was such that non-CS student workers
were able to continue integration, deployment, and maintenance
for years after I left. (This is a source of pride and joy for me:
  that I fanned the flame of the love for information sciences and
  web technology in young minds, through removing incidental complexity
  from their work of listening to, and serving our internal clients.)
