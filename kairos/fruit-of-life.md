## One Father, Union in Every Direction

1:7:13 is a geometric pattern of heaven that explains how heaven comes to earth.
One is spirit: existence.
Seven is incarnation: a representation, a non-abstract form, a practical instance.
Thirteen is immanence: the habitation, living, lifestyle,
dwelling, working and living among, doing life,
and "making a dent in the universe."

The Kingdom of God always moves from one to seven to thirteen.
Most churches are content, even gleefully ecstatic, to arrive at one.
Only by the outworking of the Ephesians 4 gifts of Christ do we
corporately grow into the fullness, of the stature, of Christ.

The betrothed of Christ is growing and shall become a teen.
Nothing can stop her! She is on her way to thirteen. #â€Žprogression
And then, to full, bridal, partnership and union with God The Son.
