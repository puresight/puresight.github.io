{{ page.description }}

This content is way pre alpha
under serious construction.
It is a chaotic mess of details that I want to organize and clarify and shape
into something that creates value and tells a story.
Soon hopefully!

If you're seeing this, it is because I trust you to keep it confidential,
and share with me in our conversations about the stuff.
