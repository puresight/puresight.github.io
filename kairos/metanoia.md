{{ page.description }}

This content is way pre-alpha,
under serious construction.
It is a chaotic mess of details that I want to organize and clarify and shape
into something that creates value and tells a story. (Soon, hopefully!)

If I shared this with you, it is because I trust you
to keep it confidential,
and share with me,
in our conversations about this kind of stuff.
